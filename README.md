# OpenLocate Android

OpenLocate is an OpenSource, self-hosted alternative to Google Device Manager and iCloud. Currently OpenLocate  supports Android, and allows users to locate their lost devices. Cross platform remote wipe functionality will come in the future.

> OpenLocate being developed by Henry Hoggard 
> for a final year Computer Science dissertation
> at Cardiff University.
> OpenLocate is intended to be used as a privacy conscious replacement 
> to iCloud and Google Device Manager. With OpenLocate YOU control your location data,
> rather than placing it in the hands of Google, Apple and consequently even the NSA.
